## Machine Learning : Music style detection

This project consists in developing a program in Python which will classify audio tracks according to the genre of music.

The amount of music streamed daily continues to skyrocket, especially on Internet platforms such as Soundcloud and Spotify, hence the need or the ability to instantly classify these songs into a playlist or library by genre has proven to be an important feature for any music streaming / purchase service.

The project Is achived, What is left now is only some updates to make the project look more simple and readable
